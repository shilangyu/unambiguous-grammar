> [~IMPORTANT]
> Project put on hold until further notice.

Formal specification of a language of grammars and proofs about their ambiguity.

## Building

Project needs OCaml tooling, more concretely `opam`.

```sh
opam install . # install dependencies and build (check proofs)
```

TODO: add instructions how to output OCaml code of the parser.

## Documentation

Can be found in `docs/`. Rendered documents are [here](https://github.shilangyu.dev/unambiguous-grammar/).
